--------------------
Claude Solution:

Understanding the Error
The error message is quite telling:
CopyERROR: column "type" is of type eccportal.usertype but expression is of type character varying
Hint: You will need to rewrite or cast the expression

This is a classic type mismatch problem in PostgreSQL. Your application is trying to store a string (character varying) in a column that's defined as a custom PostgreSQL enum type (eccportal.usertype).
Analyzing Your Environment
You're working with:

Spring Boot with Java 17
Migrating from Oracle (using ojdbc8) to PostgreSQL 15.6
Using Hibernate via Spring Data JPA
PostgreSQL JDBC driver version 42.6.0

The interesting part is that you have both Oracle and PostgreSQL configurations in your application.properties, which suggests you're in a transition phase or running with dual database support.

The Suggested Solution
The Stack Overflow solution suggests adding:
spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.stringtype=unspecified

This is indeed a valid approach, and here's why it works:
When this property is set to "unspecified", the PostgreSQL JDBC driver changes how it handles string parameters sent to the database. Normally, it would send them as VARCHAR types, but with this setting, it sends them without a specific type annotation, allowing PostgreSQL to perform type inference or casting as needed.
This is particularly useful for enum types because it lets PostgreSQL convert the string to the enum type automatically instead of the driver enforcing a strict VARCHAR type.
Is This the Right Solution for You?
For your specific situation - migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL without modifying the database schema - this is likely the most straightforward solution. Here's why:

It's non-invasive: You don't need to modify your entity classes or create custom converters.
Works with existing code: Your application can continue sending strings, and PostgreSQL will handle the conversion.
Minimal configuration: Just one line in your application.properties file.

However, there are some considerations:

It's somewhat of a workaround: It relies on PostgreSQL's type inference rather than explicit mapping.

May hide other type problems: Because it makes the driver less strict about types, it might mask other type mismatch issues.

Implementation Steps

Add this line to your application.properties file:
Copyspring.postgre.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.stringtype=unspecified

Note that I've adjusted it to use spring.postgre.datasource instead of spring.datasource since that appears to be your PostgreSQL-specific prefix based on your other properties.

If you're using multiple data sources, make sure this property is applied to the PostgreSQL one.

Restart your application and test the functionality that was previously failing.

Why Other Solutions May Not Be as Suitable
The other approaches I mentioned earlier (Attribute Converters, @Type annotations, custom UserTypes) would require you to:

Know the exact values in your PostgreSQL enum type
Create matching Java enum classes
Modify your entity classes
Possibly adjust your business logic

While these approaches provide more explicit type safety, they require more code changes. Given your constraint of not wanting to alter the database and looking for a simple solution, the HikariCP property approach is indeed appropriate.
A Complete Solution
For a comprehensive solution, I'd recommend:

Add the property to your PostgreSQL data source configuration:
Copyspring.postgre.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.stringtype=unspecified

Consider updating your PostgreSQL driver to the latest version (currently 42.7.1) for better compatibility with PostgreSQL 15.6:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <version>42.7.1</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

If you encounter other type-related issues, you might need to implement more specific solutions for those cases.

This approach should resolve your immediate issue without requiring database schema changes or significant code modifications, making it ideal for a migration scenario where minimizing changes is a priority.

PostgreSQL v15.6 Upgrade/RHEL migration problem 2-26-2025

PostgreSQL v15.6 Upgrade/RHEL migration problem to be solved:
ERROR: column "type" is of type eccportal.usertype but expression is of type character varying\n  Hint: You will need to rewrite or cast the expression

The above solution is from Copilot used with Intellij and is NOT adequate.

---------------------------

Core Issue Analysis
PostgreSQL Enum vs. Hibernate's Default Mapping
PostgreSQL enums require explicit type casting, whereas Hibernate maps Java enums to either:

EnumType.ORDINAL: Stores the enum's zero-based index as an integer.

EnumType.STRING: Stores the enum's name() value as a VARCHAR18.

When using @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING), Hibernate sends the enum's name as a VARCHAR, which PostgreSQL rejects for enum-typed columns without explicit casting16.

Solution 1: Custom Hibernate UserType with Hypersistence Utils
Step 1: Implement a Custom UserType
Extend Hibernate’s EnumType to enforce PostgreSQL enum casting via Types.OTHER:

java
import org.hibernate.engine.spi.SharedSessionContractImplementor;  
import org.hibernate.usertype.EnumType;  
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;  
import java.sql.SQLException;  
import java.sql.Types;  

public class PostgreSQLEnumType extends EnumType<Enum<?>> {  
    @Override  
    public void nullSafeSet(  
        PreparedStatement st,  
        Object value,  
        int index,  
        SharedSessionContractImplementor session  
    ) throws SQLException {  
        st.setObject(  
            index,  
            value != null ? ((Enum<?>) value).name() : null,  
            Types.OTHER  
        );  
    }  
}  
Step 2: Configure Entity Mapping
Annotate the enum field with @Type and specify the PostgreSQL enum type using columnDefinition:

java
@Entity  
@Table(name = "user_table")  
public class User {  
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue  
    private Long id;  

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)  
    @Column(columnDefinition = "eccportal.usertype")  
    @Type(PostgreSQLEnumType.class)  
    private UserType userType;  

    // Getters and setters  
}  
Step 3: Dependency Configuration
For Hibernate 6.x, include Hypersistence Utils:

xml
<dependency>  
    <groupId>io.hypersistence</groupId>  
    <artifactId>hypersistence-utils-hibernate-60</artifactId>  
    <version>3.7.0</version>  
</dependency>  
Key Benefits
Avoids schema changes by aligning Java enums with PostgreSQL enums.

Ensures Hibernate sends values as Types.OTHER, triggering PostgreSQL’s enum parsing58.

Solution 2: @ColumnTransformer for Explicit Casting
Entity Configuration
Use @ColumnTransformer to cast the string to the PostgreSQL enum type during SQL operations:

java
@Entity  
@Table(name = "user_table")  
public class User {  
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue  
    private Long id;  

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)  
    @Column(name = "user_type")  
    @ColumnTransformer(  
        read = "user_type::text",  
        write = "?::eccportal.usertype"  
    )  
    private UserType userType;  
}  
Advantages
Explicitly casts the string to the PostgreSQL enum in both read/write operations.

No external dependencies required1014.

Solution 3: JDBC Connection Parameter stringtype=unspecified
Add the parameter to the PostgreSQL JDBC URL to treat string literals as unknown, allowing implicit casting:

text
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dbname?stringtype=unspecified  
Considerations
May require adjusting existing queries to avoid ambiguous type resolution713.

Global setting affecting all string parameters; test thoroughly.

Version-Specific Adjustments
Hibernate 6 Compatibility
Deprecated @TypeDef: Replace with @JdbcType and @JdbcTypeCode:

java
@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)  
@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.NAMED_ENUM)  
@JdbcType(PostgreSQLEnumJdbcType.class)  
@Column(columnDefinition = "eccportal.usertype")  
private UserType userType;  
Ensure PostgreSQLEnumJdbcType is configured to resolve the correct enum type name14.

RHEL-Specific Migration Steps
Validate Extension Compatibility:
Confirm eccportal.usertype is allowlisted in PostgreSQL 15.6 on RHEL 9411.

Fast Upgrade Method:
Use pg_upgrade for minimal downtime, ensuring max_replication_slots and max_wal_senders are configured4.

Debugging and Validation
Common Pitfalls
Enum Name Mismatch: Java enum name() must match PostgreSQL enum variants exactly613.

Schema Validation: Temporarily disable with:

text
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none  
Testing
Verify SQL casts in generated queries:

sql
INSERT INTO user_table (user_type) VALUES ('ADMIN'::eccportal.usertype);  
Conclusion
The error stems from Hibernate’s default string-based enum mapping conflicting with PostgreSQL’s strict type system. By implementing a custom UserType, leveraging Hypersistence Utils, or using @ColumnTransformer, the mismatch is resolved without altering the database schema. For RHEL migrations, ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL 15.6 and utilize fast upgrade methods where applicable.

Recommendation: Use Solution 1 (Hypersistence Utils) for maintainability, or Solution 2 for simplicity in smaller projects. Avoid stringtype=unspecified in environments with strict type safety requirements.


How can I properly cast the "type" column to match the expected type?

Resolving PostgreSQL Enum Casting Issues in Hibernate Migrations Without Schema Changes
This report addresses the PostgreSQL ERROR: column "type" is of type eccportal.usertype but expression is of type character varying encountered during Spring Boot/Hibernate migrations. The solution focuses on Java code adjustments to align Hibernate’s enum handling with PostgreSQL’s native enum requirements, avoiding schema modifications.

Core Problem: Hibernate-PostgreSQL Enum Mismatch
PostgreSQL Enum Constraints
PostgreSQL enum columns (eccportal.usertype) enforce strict type checks, rejecting values not explicitly cast to the enum type19. Hibernate’s default EnumType.STRING maps Java enums to VARCHAR columns, causing type mismatches during inserts/updates1915.

Schema Validation Conflicts
Hibernate validates column types against entity mappings. If the database column is a PostgreSQL enum but the entity uses @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING), validation fails since Hibernate expects a VARCHAR115.

Solution 1: Hypersistence Utils for Seamless Enum Mapping
Step 1: Dependency Integration
Include Hypersistence Utils for Hibernate 6.x to simplify PostgreSQL enum handling13:

xml
<dependency>  
    <groupId>io.hypersistence</groupId>  
    <artifactId>hypersistence-utils-hibernate-60</artifactId>  
    <version>3.7.0</version>  
</dependency>  
Step 2: Entity Configuration
Annotate the enum field with @Type and specify the PostgreSQL enum type:

java
@Entity  
@Table(name = "user_table")  
public class User {  
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue  
    private Long id;  

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)  
    @Column(columnDefinition = "eccportal.usertype")  
    @Type(io.hypersistence.utils.hibernate.type.basic.PostgreSQLEnumType.class)  
    private UserType userType;  
}  
@Type: Forces Hibernate to use Hypersistence’s PostgreSQLEnumType, casting Java enums to PostgreSQL enums1915.

columnDefinition: Explicitly declares the column’s PostgreSQL enum type, bypassing schema validation errors15.

Mechanism
Hypersistence’s PostgreSQLEnumType overrides Hibernate’s default enum serialization, sending values as Types.OTHER instead of VARCHAR. This triggers PostgreSQL’s native enum parsing19.

Solution 2: Custom UserType with Explicit Casting
Step 1: Implement a Custom UserType
Extend Hibernate’s EnumType to handle PostgreSQL casts912:

java
public class PostgreSQLEnumType extends EnumType<Enum<?>> {  
    @Override  
    public void nullSafeSet(  
        PreparedStatement st,  
        Object value,  
        int index,  
        SharedSessionContractImplementor session  
    ) throws SQLException {  
        st.setObject(  
            index,  
            value != null ? ((Enum<?>) value).name() : null,  
            Types.OTHER  
        );  
    }  
}  
Step 2: Register and Apply the Custom Type
Global Registration (Hibernate 6.x):

java
@TypeDef(name = "pgsql_enum", typeClass = PostgreSQLEnumType.class)  
package com.example.model;  
Entity Usage:

java
@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)  
@Column(columnDefinition = "eccportal.usertype")  
@Type(type = "pgsql_enum")  
private UserType userType;  
Advantages
No Schema Changes: Aligns Java enums with PostgreSQL enums directly915.

Explicit Casting: Uses Types.OTHER to enforce PostgreSQL’s enum parsing19.

Solution 3: @ColumnTransformer for SQL-Level Casting
Entity Configuration
Use @ColumnTransformer to cast values explicitly in SQL711:

java
@Entity  
@Table(name = "user_table")  
public class User {  
    @Id  
    @GeneratedValue  
    private Long id;  

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)  
    @Column(name = "user_type")  
    @ColumnTransformer(  
        read = "user_type::text",  
        write = "?::eccportal.usertype"  
    )  
    private UserType userType;  
}  
Behavior
Read: Converts PostgreSQL enum to VARCHAR for Java enum mapping.

Write: Casts Java enum names to eccportal.usertype during inserts/updates711.

Version-Specific Adjustments
Hibernate 6.x Compatibility
Deprecated @TypeDef: Use @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.NAMED_ENUM) for Hibernate 6.x915:

java
@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)  
@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.NAMED_ENUM)  
@Column(columnDefinition = "eccportal.usertype")  
private UserType userType;  
Schema Validation: Disable temporarily if conflicts persist915:

text
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none  
Validation and Testing
SQL Query Verification
Ensure Hibernate generates queries with explicit casts511:

sql
INSERT INTO user_table (user_type) VALUES ('ADMIN'::eccportal.usertype);  
Enum Name Consistency
Verify Java enum name() matches PostgreSQL enum variants exactly (case-sensitive)19.

Conclusion
The error arises from Hibernate’s default enum handling conflicting with PostgreSQL’s strict type system. To resolve it without altering the schema:

Hypersistence Utils: Optimal for maintainability and compatibility with Hibernate 6.x1315.

Custom UserType: Provides granular control for legacy systems912.

@ColumnTransformer: Simplifies SQL-level casting for smaller projects711.

Recommendation: Use Hypersistence Utils for robust, production-ready enum mapping. For PostgreSQL-specific optimizations, combine @Type with columnDefinition to align Hibernate with database enum types

PostgreSQL v15.6 Upgrade/RHEL migration problem 2-26-2025

PostgreSQL v15.6 Upgrade/RHEL migration problem to be solved:
ERROR: column "type" is of type eccportal.usertype but expression is of type character varying\n  Hint: You will need to rewrite or cast the expression

The above solution is from Copilot used with Intellij and is NOT adequate.

----------------- Solution ------------------

Troubleshooting PostgreSQL v15.6 Upgrade/RHEL Migration Issues
Migrating to a new database version or operating system can be a complex process, often introducing unexpected issues. This article addresses a common problem encountered during a PostgreSQL v15.6 upgrade and RHEL migration, specifically the error message: "ERROR: column "type" is of type eccportal.usertype but expression is of type character varying\n Hint: You will need to rewrite or cast the expression". We'll explore the potential causes of this error and provide effective solutions.

Understanding the Error
This error arises from a type mismatch between a column named "type" in your database and the value you're trying to insert or compare it with. The column "type" has a user-defined data type called eccportal.usertype, while the expression you're using is of type character varying, which is a data type that can store variable-length character strings . PostgreSQL is strict about type compatibility and won't allow you to directly compare or assign values of different types without proper conversion.   

To understand this further, let's delve into what eccportal.usertype might represent. Imagine you have a box labeled "fruit" that can hold different kinds of fruit. You can't put a vegetable in that box because it's designed specifically for fruit. Similarly, eccportal.usertype is like a special container in your database designed to hold a specific kind of data. In PostgreSQL, user-defined types can be created using the CREATE TYPE command . These types can represent composite structures, similar to a row in a table, containing multiple attributes with their own data types .  Essentially, eccportal.usertype is a custom data type defined specifically for your database schema. It's crucial to understand its structure and how it's intended to be used before attempting any solutions . A thorough analysis of this user-defined type will help you choose the most appropriate solution and avoid unintended consequences.   

Investigating the Problem
This error originated during a PostgreSQL upgrade to version 15.6 and a migration to the RHEL operating system. This context is important because compatibility issues can arise between the new PostgreSQL version, the operating system, and the existing database schema . To effectively troubleshoot this issue, we need to gather more information about the eccportal.usertype and the context in which the error occurs. Here's a step-by-step approach:   

Define eccportal.usertype: Examine the definition of eccportal.usertype in your PostgreSQL database. This will reveal the underlying data type(s) it comprises. You can use the following database command to get the definition:
SQL

\d+ eccportal.usertype
This command will provide details about the type's attributes, including their data types and any constraints.

Check for Type Mapping: Investigate whether your Spring Boot application has a corresponding type mapping defined for eccportal.usertype. Spring Boot often uses object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate to map database types to Java objects. If a mapping is missing or incorrect, it can lead to type mismatches. This is similar to having a translator between two languages. If the translator doesn't understand one of the languages, communication will break down. In this case, the ORM framework acts as a translator between your Java application and the PostgreSQL database. The application.properties file plays a crucial role in configuring the connection between your Spring Boot application and the PostgreSQL database. Here are the relevant properties found in the file:
Property	Value	Description
spring.datasource.driver-class-name	oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver	Specifies the driver class for Oracle database
spring.postgre.datasource.driver-class-name	org.postgresql.Driver	Specifies the driver class for PostgreSQL database
spring.datasource.url	jdbc:oracle:thin	Specifies the connection URL for Oracle database
spring.postgre.datasource.type	com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource	Specifies the data source type as HikariCP

Export to Sheets
Additionally, the pom.xml file defines the project dependencies, including the necessary libraries for interacting with the database. Here are the relevant entries from the pom.xml file:

XML

<java.version>17</java.version>
<dependency>
    <artifactId>ojdbc8</artifactId>
    <version>19.3.0.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <version>42.6.0</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
These entries specify the Java version, the Oracle JDBC driver, the Spring Boot starter for JPA, and the PostgreSQL driver.

Verify the Expression: Ensure that the expression being compared to the "type" column is indeed of type character varying. If it's not, you'll need to cast it to the correct type before making the comparison. For instance, if the expression is an integer, you can cast it to character varying using the CAST() function in PostgreSQL:
SQL

CAST(expression AS character varying)
Potential Solutions
Based on the investigation, here are some potential solutions to address the error:

Casting the Expression: If you're certain that the character varying expression can be safely converted to eccportal.usertype, you can cast it directly in your database command. However, this approach requires careful consideration of the underlying data types and potential data loss. For example, if eccportal.usertype expects a specific format or structure, simply casting a string might not be sufficient. It's important to ensure that the string value conforms to the expected format of eccportal.usertype. Otherwise, you might encounter data truncation or corruption.

Modifying the Column Type: If eccportal.usertype is no longer necessary or if its functionality can be achieved with a simpler data type like character varying, you could consider altering the column type in your database schema. However, this requires careful planning and may involve data migration. Before making any changes to the column type, it's crucial to back up your data and thoroughly test the modifications in a non-production environment.

Implementing a Custom Type Converter: For complex user-defined types, creating a custom type converter in your Spring Boot application provides a more robust and maintainable solution. This allows you to define the conversion logic explicitly and handle potential errors gracefully. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex data transformations or when you need to perform additional validation during the conversion process.

Addressing the Stack Overflow Suggestion
The Stack Overflow suggestion to add spring.datasource.hikari.data-source-properties.stringtype=unspecified to your application.properties file might seem like a quick fix, but it's not recommended without a thorough understanding of its implications. This property affects how HikariCP, the connection pool library, handles string types. Setting it to unspecified might lead to unintended consequences and data inconsistencies. It's crucial to investigate the root cause of the type mismatch and implement a solution that addresses it directly. Improper type mapping can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption .   

Conclusion
Encountering type mismatches during database migrations is not uncommon, especially when dealing with user-defined types and complex database schemas. The error message "ERROR: column "type" is of type eccportal.usertype but expression is of type character varying" indicates a type incompatibility between a user-defined type and a character varying expression. To resolve this issue, it's essential to understand the structure and purpose of the user-defined type, investigate the context of the error, and choose an appropriate solution. Casting the expression, modifying the column type, or implementing a custom type converter are potential solutions, each with its own considerations and implications. Remember to thoroughly test your application after implementing any changes to verify data integrity and functionality. By carefully analyzing the problem and implementing a suitable solution, you can ensure a smooth transition to PostgreSQL v15.6 on RHEL and maintain the integrity of your data.
